## Introduction

Delicious food is made all over the world and every region has its characteristics.
From the hot and spicy Asian kitchen, through the exquisitely staged dishes of
France to the barbeques of Northern America you can be ensured to never go
hungry if you are open and willing to try new taste experiences.

Indian cuisine is very popular around the world. Hot curries with lots of chillies
and a side of raita to cool down. Dishes are based on rice and often vegetarian or
with seafood. Coriander, ginger, cumin, cardamom, saffron and nutmeg favoured
flavour makers/spices.

As the popularity of different international cuisines is increasing worldwide and
Indian diaspora being one of the largest among the world. Many international
food chains do not want to miss this opportunity to set-up their restaurants. But
setting up a restaurant requires many factors to be taken into consideration.
Particularly, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important decisions
that will determine whether the mall will be a success or failure.

## Business Problem

The objective of this capstone project is to analyze and select the best locations in
New York City, USA to open a Japanese cuisine restaurant. Using Data Science
Methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to
provide solutions to answer the question: If a successful owner of multiple mid to
high-end restaurants decided to open a new Indian restaurant in New York City,
where would you recommend they open it?

## Target Audience

This project is particularly useful for the owners of international food chains for
Indian cuisine or other people who are looking to invest in setting up an Indian
cuisine restaurant in New York City, USA.


Taking into account the price level at which the restaurant will operate, the intent
is to find an optimal location in an area, where gastronomy is booming and which
is easily accessible for Indians and local citizens as well.

## Data

To perform this analysis, we will need the following data:

1. List of the Neighbourhoods of NYC
2. Geo-coordinates of the Neighbourhoods in NYC
3. Top venues in those Neighbourhoods

List of districts will be obtained from the following website

(https://yourneighborhood.co/neighborhood/list)

Geo-coordinates of districts will be obtained with the help of the geocoder tool in
the notebook.

Top venues data will be obtained from Foursquare through an API.
